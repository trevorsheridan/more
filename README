-- WORKING DRAFT --

More is a command line utility to rapidly compile LESS (http://lesscss.org/) into static CSS. It's current goal is to provide the missing "watch" functionality that the current LESS CLI doesn't provide, as well as persist the compiler's instructions (which is extremely useful when working in a large team). The next release will focus on minifying the CSS output. Future releases will aim to incorporate other CSS superset languages like Stylus, Sass, and Compass.

INSTALLATION

More requires that your system have Node >= 5.0 and NPM (node package manager) installed.

More is not available in the NPM registry, however, installation is quite simple. To install the latest version of More either clone and checkout a stable tag, or download the latest tag from Github. To install More globally on your system, open a terminal and execute the following command in the "more" directory:

  $ sudo npm install -g

That's it! Now you can do whatever you'd like with the More directory. To uninstall More from your system, execute:

  $ sudo npm uninstall -g more
