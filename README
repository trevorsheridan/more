Sift is a command line utility to rapidly compile Less into static CSS.

### Install

#### Node

Node.js >= 5.0 must be installed. To see which version of Node is installed on your system, open a terminal and type `node -v`. If Node isn't installed on your system download the package-installer for your OS (preferred) or build from source; installers are located at: http://nodejs.org/#download.

#### NPM

Next install the Node Package Manager (NPM). To do so run the following command: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` or `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`.

#### Sift

Once you've installed Node and NPM clone the latest stable release from Github, navigate to the "sift" directory in a terminal and type `sudo npm install -g`. This will install Sift globally. You can now do whatever you want with the Sift clone.

### Uninstall

To uninstall Sift run the command: `sudo npm uninstall -g sift`.

### Config

In order to compile CSS, config.json must be present in the directory where you want to execute sift.

#### config.json:

```json
{ "compiler": {
    "css": {
      "input": "./less",
      "output": "./compiled",
      "relation": {
        "base.less": "base.css",
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Commands

compile: Invoke the compilers for the specified languages, which happens to only be Less at the moment.
    -c, --css:   Compile all `.less` files into the corresponding `.css` files defined in config.json.
    -w, --watch: Start watching for changes on all files in the current working directory, and it's children. `ctrl + c` to exit.
  
-v, --version: Display the current version of sift.

Examples:

`sift compile --css`
    Compile `.less` files into `.css` and return control to the user.
  
`sift compile --css --watch`
    Start watching for changes on all less files, compile if any file is directly or indirectly referenced in config.json.
