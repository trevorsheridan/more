-- WORKING DRAFT --

More is a command line utility to rapidly compile LESS (http://lesscss.org/) into static CSS. It's current goal is to provide the missing "watch" functionality that the current LESS CLI doesn't provide, as well as persist the compiler's instructions (which is extremely useful when working in a large team). The next release will focus on minifying the CSS output. Future releases will aim to incorporate other CSS superset languages like Stylus, Sass, and Compass.

INSTALLATION

More requires that your system have Node >= 5.0 and NPM (node package manager) installed.

Installation is quite simple...

  $ sudo npm install -g more

...and so is uninstalling!

  $ sudo npm uninstall -g more

CONFIGURATION

In order to compile CSS, config.json must be present in the directory
where you want to execute the `mo` command.

config.json:

{ "compiler": {
    "css": {
      "input": "./less",
      "output": "./compiled",
      "relation": {
        "base.less": "base.css",
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
